		<p>ROMPERS-appeared in the United States of America in the early 1900s. They were popular
				as playwear for younger children because people thought they were ideal for movement.
				Rompers were in many ways the first modern casual clothes for children. They were light 
				and loose fitting, a major change from the much more restrictive clothing children wore 
				during the 19th-century Victorian era. Styles and conventions varied from country to country. 
				In France they were, for many years, only for boys. While primarily a play garment, some
				French children wore dressy rompers.[citation needed] Their popularity peaked in the 1950s 
				when they were used by children as play wear and by women as leisureâ€”and beachwear. Thereafter
				the garment has continued to be used by infants and toddlers; however, it has become less
				common among older girls and women, although never disappearing entirely.</p>
